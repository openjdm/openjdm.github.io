# The Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic

Barbara Hernandez & Charles Hicks

What factors do you take into
consideration when making an estimate? Do you rely on your previous
experiences, do you think about whether a guess is reasonable, do you
compare values? What about the information you were previously exposed
to? In this chapter, we will discuss the anchoring and adjustment
heuristic, by which individuals’ estimations are based on an initial
value they do not sufficiently account for (Tversky and Kahneman 1973,
1128). We will summarize a few articles that discuss this heuristic and
explain how this bias can be found in the medical field.

## Estimating Unknown Events

Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman
published an article in 1974 in which they presented a series of
heuristics that we use when making decisions about things we are
unfamiliar with (Tversky and Kahneman 1973, 1124). One of the heuristics
Tversky and Kahneman included was the *anchoring and adjustment
heuristic*. Before explaining the studies they conducted to test this
concept, let’s see how you respond to this question!

*Instructions: Quick! You have five seconds to calculate the answer to
this multiplication. If today’s date is an odd number, answer the first
multiplication. If today is an even number, look at the second
multiplication.*

8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1


  

*-------------------------------------*

  

1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8

  

  

The answer to this multiplication
was 40, 320. How did you do?


This example is a short version of the experiment carried out by Tversky
and Kahneman (1128). They found that the sequence of multiplication
individuals were assigned influenced their final estimation, as
individuals with the high-to-low multiplication scored an average 2,250
while those with the low-to-high list averaged 512 (1128). In this
example, since you only had five seconds to answer, the information you
anchored your decision on was likely the first few numbers in the
multiplication, which is why we can expect people who were assigned to
the first multiplication to have a higher average estimate while those
who were exposed to the second multiplication calculated a lower average
response. To explain the results of their experiment, the authors note
that individuals may make a few estimates that serve as a baseline and
do not change their computations enough (1128). Essentially, what the
authors are trying to demonstrate is that individuals will use the first
information they observe to calculate a final value but do not
sufficiently adjust their estimates.

A second experiment carried out by Tversky and Kahneman asked
participants to spin a wheel and based on the value the wheel fell on,
indicate whether it overestimated or underestimated a value such as the
number of African countries that are part of the UN and then provide an
estimate of that value (1128). Participants with higher numbers on the
wheel had higher estimations than those with lower numbers on the
spinning wheel (1128). Through Tversky and Kahneman’s experiments, we
observe how random information researchers provide can lead to over or
underestimations.

In their 1999 article, Thomas Mussweiler and Fritz Strack elaborate on
the origins of Tversky and Kahneman’s anchoring heuristic. Mussweiler
and Strack propose that the anchoring heuristic occurs by individuals
selecting information that convinces them that the anchor provided is
the same as the correct response (Mussweiler and Strack 1999, 145).
Essentially, this theory suggests that when we are given an anchor, our
decision making is more focused on finding information that confirms
that value than on finding information that provides a different
response (145-146).

Like Tversky and Kahneman’s study, Mussweiler and Strack’s research
looked at externally-generated anchors. However, what happens when
individuals generate their own anchors? In the following article, we
look at research that explores how the anchoring and adjustment
heuristic is manifested in internally-generated anchors.

In their article, Nicholas Epley and Thomas Gilovich studied
individuals’ anchoring and adjustment mechanisms when anchors are
created by participants. Epley and Gilovich challenged Mussweiler and
Strack’s theory on selective accessibility, arguing that since
individuals know whether their anchor is accurate or not, individuals
adjust their answers based on their initial estimate rather than using
prior experience and selective information to confirm a value (391). In
one experiment, researchers asked participants questions they would have
an initial self-generated value to and questions they would not have any
self-generated anchors to base their answer on (392). In their
experiment, researchers recorded participants’ reasoning for arriving at
an answer and had two independent reviewers assess whether participants
used anchors in their reasoning (392). The researchers found higher
rates of anchoring and adjustment for self-generated values than for
those that were external (392), suggesting that the anchoring and
adjustment heuristic is present when individuals generate the anchors
themselves than when they are created by researchers.

These three articles have provided an overview of initial conception of
how anchors, regardless of how relevant they are, are used by
individuals to generate estimates while also questioning whether anchors
generated by experimenters yield the same results on estimation as when
they are created by individuals.

## Reinventing the Wheel

<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In all of Tversky and Kahnemnan’s
findings, some of the most confounding were those focused on randomly
selected anchors. When presented with a logical problem regarding
approximation, why should a value selected by a spinning wheel influence
our opinion? As our minds are presented with the wheel’s selection, our
association between the value and the estimation is factored in our
approximations. While this speaks to our ability to make quick
estimations, it also exposes some faults in our cognitive processes that
are explored in the following section.

  
## Real World Implications*

Although heuristics can help us
make quick judgments or make complicated decisions on a daily basis,
these mechanisms can lead to biases. The following section is focused on
providing examples of the effects the anchoring and adjustment
heuristics can have on patients and medics. 

One way in which the anchoring and
adjustment bias may present itself in the medical field is how patients
misconstrue the probability of having a disease (Senay and Kaphingst
2009, 193). Although patients may be told they are statistically
unlikely to have a disease, they continue to think they are likely to
get sick because they base their judgment on their own perception of
self-risk instead of incorporating the probability provided by the
physician (195). In this case, a self-generated anchor impedes patients
from adjusting to an externally-calculated probability.

Another way this heuristic is manifested in the medical field is in the
diagnoses physicians give to patients. In a case review, Edward Etchells
described the case of a man who was incorrectly diagnosed by doctors
several times despite showing worsening symptoms (Etchells 2015). In
analyzing this case, the author commented on the different biases,
including the anchoring and adjustment heuristic, that may have
influenced the doctors’ misdiagnosis (Etchells 2015). In the article,
Etchells argued that the anchoring and adjustment heuristic, along with
other biases, prevents physicians from changing their diagnoses despite
patients displaying symptoms that do not match their initial
diagnosis.

## Conclusion

The anchoring and adjustment
heuristic emphasizes the important role exposure to information can have
in coming to an estimation or judgment. In this final section, we have
some questions to think back on the content presented in this chapter
and ways the content can be applied to the real world.

  

## Review Questions

1.  What is the anchoring and adjustment heuristic?
2.  What are some studies conducted on the topic? What did they show?
3.  What are the two types of anchors people can be exposed to? Do these make a difference in the
calculation of final results? Why or why not?
4.  What are the ways in which individuals modify their decisions?
5.  What are some real-world examples of this heuristic that were not mentioned in this chapter?
6.  Why does this heuristic matter?
