# Psych 154: Judgment and Decision Making

*Instructor*: Professor Russ Poldrack  

## Overview

We make decisions every day, from relatively inconsequential (such as
what to eat for breakfast) to very important (such as who to elect as
president). This course will
provide an overview of the main approaches to the experimental study of
how we make decisions. We
will contrast *normative* approaches (which describe how decisions
*should* be made) with *descriptive* approaches (which describe how they
are *actually* made). We will also contrast multiple approaches,
including behavioral, computational, and neuroscientific approaches to
the study of decision making.  
The centerpiece of the course will be a group project in which we
develop an open source textbook on the course topic.<span
class="Apple-converted-space">  Since no such textbook exists at
present, this will be an important contribution on your part.

## Course learning goals:

-   Define key features of the
    normative, descriptive, neuroscientific, and computational
    approaches to understanding judgment and decision making, and
    describe the key evidence supporting each approach
-   Demonstrate the ability to
    dissect and understand published research papers in this area.
-   Use knowledge of concepts
    from the science of judgment and decision making to describe in
    nonspecialist language and apply to real-world problems

## Acknowledgment of Challenging Times
Students and instructors are all adjusting to the changes and
regulations that have been put in place this year in response to
COVID-19. We hope that we will all work together as a community to
adapt to these times and this new situation as best as we can. We
have tried to add flexibility to our course structure and
assignments to accommodate anyone who may now be lacking resources
they originally thought they would have available. If you find
yourself facing additional challenges that make it difficult for you
to keep up with the course work, please let me know and we can
figure out a way to support you. We will not ask you to explain the
details of your situation. So, please do not hesitate to reach out
to any of the teaching team members. If you have suggestions for how
we might better support your learning in this course, during these
trying times, please do not hesitate to let us know.

## Course structure

This course has been heavily remodeled for Spring 2021 to adapt it
to a virtual learning environment. The course will be focused
around Canvas modules, with one module for each week. Each module
will include:

-   1-2 readings
-   2-3 short lecture videos
-   A quiz (graded for completion; must score 100% to receive credit,
    can retake as many times as needed)
-   Some modules will include milestones related to the final
    project.
-   A learning diary in which the student reflects on their course engagement and progress towards
    learning goals for the week

All activities for a module must be completed by Sunday at 11:59 PM PST in order to receive credit.

The modules for the current week as well as the following two
modules will be available on Canvas throughout the quarter.<span
class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This allows you to get ahead
if needed, while still ensuring a spacing of activities across the
quarter that is beneficial for long-term learning.
  
There will be synchronous sessions via Zoom, lasting 50 minutes and
    starting at the scheduled class time (TuTh 10:30AM - 11:20AM PST);
    you can find the links to these sessions on Canvas. Each student
    will be expected to attend at least one of these sessions every
    week, or complete a makeup assignment. <span
    class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

## Final Project

A central aspect of this course will be a final project on which the
    entire class will collaborate to develop an [open-source textbook on
    Judgment and Decision Making](https://openjdm.github.io/).  Students will work in pairs to choose a topic of interest and write the chapter together.
     
### Project Milestones:

-   Week 3: initial table of
    contents, each student chooses a topic and provides a proposed
    real-world example
-   Week 4: Finalized table of
    contents
-   Week 5: One-page proposal:
    Chapter outline and proposed references
-   Week 6: Peer review of
    chapter proposals (each student reviews 3 proposals)
-   Week 8: Initial draft of
    chapter (~1000-2000 words)
-   Week 9: Peer review of
    initial draft (each student reviews 1 draft)
-   Week 10: Completed chapter
    due

Note: Because these chapters will be made available online, it is
*absolutely essential* that you do not plagiarize or patch-write
(i.e. copying text and then changing words). The entire chapter must be
written in your own words.  
</span>Anyone caught plagiarizing will be reported to the Office of
Community Standards; there will be no tolerance.

## Virtual learning: norms and expectations

In order to make the best of Zoom-based meetings, please observe the
    following guidelines:

-   While you are not required to keep your video turned on during
    synchronous sessions, we ask that you keep it on if possible as it
    allows more personal connection between students and instructors.
-   Keep yourself muted unless you are speaking.
-   If you wish to speak, using the Raise Hand button in Zoom and
    wait to be called upon.
-   Once you have finished speaking, please mute yourself and lower
    your hand.
-   You may post questions to the Chat window.
-   Please be very mindful about the use of private chats within
    Zoom; in general, don't write anything that you wouldn't want the
    entire class to see.  
    </span>Remember, there is no delete button...

## Assessment without grading
There is [<span class="s1">growing
concern</span>](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/02/professors-reflections-their-experiences-ungrading-spark-renewed-interest-student)
amongst educators that grades are antithetical to learning and
student motivation. In
this course, you will not receive standard grades during the course
of the quarter. Rather,
you will be prompted to reflect on your own engagement and learning
each week in a learning diary. At the end of the quarter,
you will evaluate how well you think you did in the class and
propose a fair grade, with evidence to support your proposal. Each
student will meet with Dr. Poldrack in the last week of the quarter
and we will determine your final letter grade together. In this
class, *you are ultimately responsible* for making the commitment to
be an active member of a learning community and for honestly
assessing how effectively you have done so. Assessment without grading
*does not* mean that everyone gets to assign themself an A+; the
proposed grade must match the degree of commitment and engagement
that you demonstrated throughout the quarter. 

The class involves a number of different learning opportunities, and
your argument for a specific final grade must rest directly on the
specific opportunities that you engaged in across the quarter.<span
class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The learning opportunities
will include (with their relative proportion of importance):

-   Quizzes (25%)
-   Participation in synchronous
    classroom sessions (or completion of makeup activities) and in-class
    presentations (25%)
-   Project milestones (including
    peer reviews, interim milestones, final submission) (50%)

You will be expected to provide details regarding your engagement in
    these opportunities and what you learned from them. If you decide that your
    workload is too high and you need to forego any of the activities
    you may do so (except for the project, which is mandatory), but you
    must factor this into your proposed final grade. For example, if you were to
    miss the synchronous sessions and fail to complete the makeup
    activities for 5 out of the 10 weeks, then the maximum grade you
    should propose would be a B (since classroom activities are worth
    25% of the grade, so missing half of them would result in a maximum
    grade of 87.5%).
  
## Office hours
Prof. Poldrack will hold online co-working/office hours on Mondays
from 8-9:30 AM PST, and Thursdays 2-3 PM PST. See Canvas for the Zoom
link. You should feel
free to treat this as a co-working time; Prof. Poldrack will be
there to answer questions as needed, but you can join and lurk
without asking any questions if you wish.
