<h1>The neural basis of simple decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-neural-basis-of-simple-decisions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Austin Brotman &amp; Kyler Presho</p>
<p>We encounter perceptual decisions every day. Is this shirt red or
orange? Which direction is that bird flying? Am I driving faster or
slower than the car in front of me? Generally, they are answers to the
question âWhat state of the world is most consistent with what my senses
perceive?â As simple as this question might seem, understanding how the
brain arrives at an answer has been an important area of research for
understanding the neuroscience of judgement and decision making. Beneath
the surface are questions about how the brain represents, integrates,
and utilizes uncertain information filtered through the nervous system.
Efforts on this front have uncovered probable mechanisms facilitating
information representation, evidence accumulation, and termination of
decisions in several areas of the brain, as well as theoretical models
of how perceptual decisions are made.</p>
<p>To better illustrate the decision making process, we will contextualize
the course of a perceptual decision with an experimental scenario
frequently used to investigate the phenomenon: the direction
discrimination task. A participant (often a monkey) is positioned in
front of a cluster of moving dots. The movement of a subset of the dots
is correlated, while the remainder move randomly. The participant is
trained to judge which direction the correlated set of dots is moving
and indicate their decision via eye movement. During the experiment,
researchers are able to record neural activity from the agentâs brain.
An advantage to this experimental design is that researchers can vary
the uncertainty of the environmental stimulus. They do so by varying the
strength with which the dotsâ movement is correlated. Additionally, they
can model non-binary decisions by expanding the number of directions the
dots are able to move. We will reference this scenario as we outline a
decisionâs underlying representation and interpretation, the process of
integrating information, and termination.</p>

<p><img alt="example of procedure" src="_images/dd_procedure.png" /></p>
<p>Caption: Stages of the motion discrimination task. First, the subject
fixates on a fixation point. Next, the moving dot stimulus is displayed
around the fixation point. Finally, the participant indicates a decision
by directing an eye movement to one of the targets.</p>
<p>Representation of Information</p>
<p>Regardless of the stage of the decision making process, it is important
to understand the way neural activity represents information. The most
commonly examined metric for neural activity is firing rate. In the case
of a single neuron, this is straightforward. Neurons in the middle
temporal lobe (MT or V5), for example, are selective for motion in a
particular direction along with the speed of that motion. When dots
within the neuronâs receptive field appear to be moving in its preferred
direction, the firing rate of the neuron will increase. As the motion
appears to orient in a direction progressively further from that which
the neuron selects for, its firing rate will decrease. This is
especially evident as the correlation of the moving dots is increased.
The information coded by these single neurons can, impressively, be
highly indicative of the subjectâs decision. The earliest work on
perceptual decision making, Newsome, Britton, and Movshon (Newsome et
al., 1989) analyzed recordings from single neurons in MT. They found
that the recordings taken from individual neurons (selected for
responsiveness to motion) were comparable in accuracy to the actual
choices of the monkeys studied. Salzman et al. (1990) then found that
altering neural firing rates of MT columns using microstimulation
significantly and reliably pushes the distribution of decisions towards
that columnâs preferred direction. While the application area of this
stimulation extends beyond a single neuron, evidence suggests the
additional neurons activated are functionally similar to the target.
This implies that the information represented by these neural firing
rates is causally connected to the subjectâs perceptual decision.</p>
<p>In the previously mentioned studies as well as other literature, the
activity levels of single neurons are strikingly predictive of subjectsâ
decisions (as well as the relationship between difficulty and
performance). The brain has access to a number of these signals and most
likely pools their inputs to form a decision. This raises an important
question: if the brain has access to highly predictive signals, why
isnât actual decision performance noticeably better than that of
individual neurons? Work by Britten et al. (1992) suggests that pooling
uncorrelated neural signals should substantially increase the accuracy
of decisions. As pools grow larger, the pooling of noisy inputs should
allow better detection of weak signals. This, however, would contradict
observed data showing that single neurons perform as well as decision
makers. Based on this contradiction, they conclude that decisions must
be made using a small number of independent signals, or a larger pool of
correlated signals. Zohary et al. (1994) found a weak correlation among
pooled neurons and established that this shared variability
asymptotically limits the improvement offered by pooling the noisy
neural signals. In light of these limits, decision performance similar
to that of individual neurons is an expected consequence of pooling
neurons for the perceptual decisions we discuss.</p>
<p>There is good reason to think this pooling of neurons offers important
benefits for perceptual decisions. Rather than having to rely on a
sufficiently large number of spikes to occur in any one neuron,
estimating the density of spikes across the pool allows for a faster
approximation of firing rate. Furthermore, collecting from a pool allows
an estimation of spike rate even during gaps in a single neuronâs spikes
(Shadlen and Kiani, 2013). This is clearly desirable given the time
sensitive nature of many perceptual decisions.</p>
<p>Interpretation as a Decision Variable</p>
<p>One important way of interpreting the neural dynamics discussed above is
by transformation into a decision variable (DV). This is a quantity over
which the brain can apply a decision rule between two options, <em>A</em> and
<em>B</em>. As the DVâs value increases, so does the support for option <em>A</em> as
opposed to <em>B</em> (or vice versa) under the decision rule. It is not the
decision itself, but a representation of accumulated evidence. Its
neural correlates may be found in different parts of the brain depending
on the kind of decision at hand, and its formation involves a
transformation from the raw activations.</p>
<p>In the context of our motion discrimination task, constructing the DV
often involves applying a transformation to averaged activations of
pools neurons. Area MT, for example, makes use of comparison and
integration. These are the subtraction of different pools of competing
neurons and the accumulation of their activations over time,
respectively. Comparison allows us to quantify the degree of belief and
integration allows us to understand processing over timescales longer
than an individual perceptual event as noted in Shadlen and Kiani
(2013).</p>
<p>Studies of the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) bear out the existence
of these transformations. Shadlen and Newsome (1996) suggests a subset
of directionally sensitive neurons within LIP encode information that is
neither a direct encoding of sensory information, nor directly
responsible for moving a subjectâs eyes. Instead, the firing rates of
these neurons in area LIP seem to reflect the slow integration of
incoming sensory information, rising in proportion to the strength of
the motion signal in the preferred direction (coherence in our motion
discrimination task). This activity has been interpreted as evidence
that neurons in area LIP act as information accumulators, though
literature on the subject is mixed. Microstimulation of the areas in
question has shown indications that LIP activity causally affect
decision performance by Hanks, Ditterich, and Shadlen (2006). These
conclusions are complicated, however, by findings from Katz et al.
(2016) showing that inactivation of the same areas does not affect task
performance. It remains unclear whether activity in area LIP is causally
related to direction descrimination, or how significant its contribution
might be if so.</p>
<p>This highlights an important consideration when analyzing neural
correlates: signals that seem highly correlated with the decision
performance of a subject may be byproducts rather than causes of the
eventual decision.</p>
<p>Evidence Accumulation</p>
<p>A crucial factor in decision making is the ability to evaluate the
relevant evidence at-hand in order to make the best perceived decision.
Experimental data from Kiani &amp; Shadlen (2009) shows that as time passes
and agents are exposed to greater amounts of pertinent evidence, the DV
trends further toward one decision threshold or another until one
boundary is crossed. However, this process is not quite so simple, as
the duration of the time it takes to make a decision can extend beyond
the natural integration time for sensory receptors (resources for
gathering evidence). This suggests that evidence accumulation is not the
only factor taken into account in the decision making process before
termination is achieved. Time, for example, may play a role when
evidence is incomplete or slowly received. There is multi-trial evidence
to suggest that accumulation is better represented by a gradual change
in neural activity along the lines of Kiani &amp; Shadlenâs integration
models than a sudden change in brain state. The pattern of gradual
accumulation visible when averaging multiple trials, though, must be
balanced with observations from Latimer et al. (2016) that individual
neurons may progress through step-like changes during single trials. One
exception to gradual accumulation may be in situations where the agent
has a change of mind; in this case, observations of neural activity tend
to show rapid brain state changes (inverting the direction of the DV)
consistent with what one might expect from such an event.</p>
<p>In order to account for both the amount of time and information
accumulated towards making a decision, a number of theoretical models
have been developed in recent decades. Of these, the predictions from
sequential sampling models have been especially effective at matching
experimental data. These models characterize the process of making a
decision as a noisy accumulation of evidence from a starting point that
terminates upon reaching a response criteria. Two examples are the Drift
Diffusion Model (Ratcliff and McCoon, 2008) and the Leaky Competitive
Accumulator Model (Usher and McClelland, 2001).<span
class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p>Termination</p>
<p>Finally, a decision in progress must terminate to be realized as a
decision. Functioning as the stopping rule based on relevant evidence
and/or time, termination occurs after a decision variable reaches or
crosses a certain threshold. In other words, once an agent is exposed to
the necessary amount of relevant information or given enough time to
make a decision, neural signals reach a level of activation that allows
the decision-making process to end (terminate).<span
class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p>Behavioral data produced by Shadlen &amp; Kiani (2013) appears to support
this threshold-based theory of termination as well. In an experiment
focused on using eye movement as decision-making criteria, they show
evidence of an expected increased firing rate in the LIP immediately
preceding eye movement (the decision being made). When the participants
(monkeys, in this case) decided to make the choice handled by the
observed section of the LIP, the activation presumably passed an
activation level or threshold that led to the actual decision being
madeâbut when the monkeys chose the other available option, this
threshold was not crossed in that same area.<span
class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<p>This mechanism, although simple, is essential to the decision-making
process. It allows an agent to take their interpretation of the DV,
time, and accumulated evidence and produce an actual decision or action.
Without setting a threshold for neural activation, there would be no
reason for the brain to stop evaluating new data and as such may never
come to make an actual decision.<span
