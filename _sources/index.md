## OpenJDM

This book aims to provide an open-source introduction to some of the basic concepts from the psychology of judgment and decision making (commonly known as "JDM"). It was produced by the students in [Psychology 154: The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making](https://github.com/openjdm/openjdm.github.io/blob/main/syllabus/syllabus_2021.md) at Stanford University, taught by Dr. Russell Poldrack in the spring quarter of 2021. Dr. Poldrack performed light editing on the final chapters in order to align their organization and format.
