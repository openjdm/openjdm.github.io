<h1>JDM Under Pressure<a class="headerlink" href="#jdm-under-pressure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>Evangeline Hong &amp; Isabelle Levent</em></p>
<p><em>Spoiler Alert: The following describes a scene from Season 2 of The
Good Place.</em></p>
<p>In the season 2 finale of The Good Place, a hilariously indecisive
character, Chidi Anagonye, is presented with a final judgment test to
determine whether he is doomed to eternal salvation or damnation: to
pick between two hats in an empty room with a timer. Following
eighty-two minutes of agony, Chidi selects the brown hat and exits the
room. The Judge swiftly condemns him to lifelong torture for taking so
long, upon which Chidi comically responds: “But did I at least choose
the right one?”</p>
<p>In the context of judgment and decision-making (JDM),
Chidi exemplifies exactly what not to do. But setting aside the comedic
exaggerations, Chidi’s struggles capture a fundamental tension in
judgement and decision making (JDM) broadly, but especially under time
pressure: balancing effort and accuracy. The effort-accuracy model
captures the inherent tradeoff between how good a choice is versus how
many resources are devoted to making that choice. The optimality of a
choice (“accuracy”) evaluates the decision ex-post based on the outcome
and the rationality of the decision-making process (Payne et al. 1996).
In other words: looking back, did I make the best decision I could? The
resources spent on a choice (“effort”) refer to how much cognitive
energy and time were allocated to reach the final decision. Since
investing more effort to learn and process your options tends to lead to
smarter and better decisions, the effort-accuracy model proposes that
there is a compromise between effort and accuracy that the
decision-maker must accept. This balancing act is particularly relevant
when effort is either costlier or objectively capped by time pressure.</p>
<p>JDM processes depend on three dimensions: the total amount of
information processed, the selectivity in information processing, and
the pattern of processing (Bettman et al. 1998). Following the framework
of the effort-accuracy model, the decision-maker could maximize accuracy
by optimizing each of these dimensions (maximum information processed
with no selectivity using a normatively perfect JDM algorithm), but it
would come at a steep cost in the amount of effort. As a result, JDM
under time pressure forces decision-makers to take adaptive approaches
towards one (or more) of these dimensions.</p>
<p>There are three main adaptive responses: changing the
speed of processing, changing the amount of information being processed,
and changing the pattern of processing (Payne et al. 1996). First,
individuals may accelerate their processing by simply spending less time
processing each piece of information. This can be accomplished by
increasing the amount of attention exerted to information processing.
But because the limitations of cognitive effort are finite, this
adaptation is mostly a first or auxiliary response. Second, individuals
may additionally reduce the amount of information processed. This can
take the form of reducing the number of sources being processed or by
reducing the amount of information absorbed per source. Since both
responses can be implemented without strategizing, they simply reduce
effort at the direct cost of accuracy. As a result, they tend to be the
most helpful when the time pressure is moderate. When time pressure is
high, however, individuals may shift their decision-making pattern to
strategically modify both the speed and selectivity of information being
processed. Specifically, individuals may shift from a depth-first
processing (where alternatives are evaluated completely and then
compared) to breadth-first processing (where attribute(s) of
alternatives are evaluated and compared). This adaptation seeks to more
efficiently allocate the limited resources to process information that
can really make a difference in the accuracy of the subsequent choice.</p>
<p>Time pressure can also be considered in the realm of risky
decision making: traders make decisions in split seconds as new
information comes in, negotiators try to reach agreements before a
deadline, bidders place bets up until the last minute <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LY4Yu8">(Kocher et al.,
2013)</a>. Research on this
topic has produced mixed outcomes. Some argue that that time pressure
unilaterally results in decreased risk taking, regardless of the type of
choices presented. Others argue that the decision making response is
more nuanced: when presented with situations that would result in gains,
<span class="s1">people are more likely to be risk-seeking under time
pressure. When presented with situations that would result in losses,
however, people are more likely to be loss averse, relying on heuristics
and choosing safer options <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?BMw3A4"><span class="s2">(Young et al.,
2012)</span></a>.<span
class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p>Outside the laboratory, risky
decisions are not generally presented as gambles. When assessing risk,
people often look for a risk-diffusing operator (RDO), an action that
would reduce the risk of a situation: taking a vaccine when going to a
country with malaria, getting insurance, making duplicates of important
documents. An experiment was done investigating whether time pressure
increases the search for an RDO. Participants were presented with a
situation in which they ran a turtle conservation reserve, and had the
choice of breeding the turles on the beach, where the water quality was
subpar, or on a little island where the water quality was better, but
there was the possibility of water mites infecting the turtle eggs.
Under time pressure, participants focused on negative consequences of
the risky choice and asked more questions about possible RDOs. The
tendency was to find a way to mitigate risk, not to reject it outright.
This provides better insight to the decision making process in the real
world than black-and-white gambles and probabilities <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?8JP9ew">(Huber &amp; Kunz,
2007)</a>.<span

<h2>Adaptation: Different Decision Making Strategies Under Time Pressure<a class="headerlink" href="#adaptation-different-decision-making-strategies-under-time-pressure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While people generally do a good job of adapting their JDM strategies
based on the context of the time pressure, failures do arise and often
are a result of one (or both) of the following shortcomings. People may
simply lack the ability to execute their selected strategy due to
computational or memory-related limitations. Alternatively, they may
lack the knowledge to assess the decision-making context or be unaware
of the strategies available to them (Payne et al., 1996).</p>
<p>Under time pressure, decision makers need to adapt their strategies.
Normative strategies, developed in economics, describe what decision
makers should do in ideal situations with infinite time to calculate and
sort through information. In time constrained situations, decision
makers employ different strategies, such as heuristics or breadth-first
(as opposed to depth-first) searches, that minimize the amount of
information processed. A common normative strategy is the weighted
additive value strategy. The decision maker considers all attributes for
each option, assigns a weight and value to each attribute, and
calculates the expected utility by summing the product of the attribute
value and weight for each option <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ny8GV7">(Payne et al.,
1996)</a>.<span

time pressure include (Bettman et al. 1998):</p>

<h2>Consumer choice<a class="headerlink" href="#consumer-choice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consumer choice refers to the
selection of products and services by consumers and is a classic context
in which decision-making has been studied. Behind each consumer
decision, there is some degree of uncertainty (the utility to be derived
from the purchase) and some need for timely decisions (either externally
imposed in bargain settings or internally imposed as opportunity cost).</p>
<p>Consumer decisions under time pressure exhibit two main changes. The
first and most prominent change in the JDM process was a shift from
depth-focused to breadth-focused strategies (Payne et al. 1996). In
other words, time pressure motivated consumers to cover as many
alternatives as they could by focusing on a select number of attributes,
rather than attempting to comprehensively evaluate each option before
moving onto the next. This can be seen in eye-tracking studies that
observed how consumers shopped under time pressure: shoppers began by
quickly scanning each of the options for their respective brand displays
(Pieters et al. 1997; Reutskaja et al. 2011). This strategic shift was
not only evidenced in how consumers collected, but also in how they
processed the information. When presented with a JDM task under time
pressure, consumers felt much more confident about their decisions when
they were presented with a breadth of information rather than a depth of
information about a limited number of options (Jacoby et al. 1994).</p>
<p>Another notable change is increased selectivity in
information processing. Under time pressure, consumers strategically
prioritize particular attributes to evaluate rather than going through
an exhaustive laundry list of product features. One common filtration
mechanism is identifying attributes that can serve as a proxy
representation of the other attributes. The most frequently cited
examples of these representative attributes are brand name and price
(Nowlis 1995; Suri and Monroe 2003). Consumers may assume that this
feature reasonably reflects information about the quality, popularity,
or other specific attributes that they no longer have to individually
reason about.</p>
<p>Time pressure elicits many adaptations from individuals as
they reason about their consumer choices: from computational shifts in
approaching the problem (breadth over depth) to implementational shifts
in executing the strategic shift (filtering of information). These
adaptive JDM strategies seem to manifest intuitively, sometimes even
without the decision-maker’s realization. For the most part, the use of
these heuristics (such as the LEX or EBA rule) have been proven to
increase the accuracy of time-constrained consumer choices relative to
making the decision using a normative strategy. In some cases, however,
JDM under time pressure breaks down. Perhaps the most extreme example of
this is seen in the occasional preference reversal between choices made
under time pressure and choices made in the absence of time constraints.
While the stakes of a suboptimal consumer decision may not be so dire,
JDM under time pressure can be found in contexts with higher stakes and
under tighter constraints. To better understand how individuals take on
these challenges, we turn to experts who operate and specialize in JDM
under time pressure.</p>

<h2>The Recognition Primed Decision Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-recognition-primed-decision-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Gary Klein, a leading figure in the field of naturalistic decision
making, proposed that experts use different strategies than novices and
that decision making in the real world is different from decision making
in a laboratory. He interviewed nurses, pilots, software engineers,
firefighters, economics professors, and soldiers–all experts in their
respective fields–and developed a new theory for expert decision making
under time pressure: the Recognition-Primed Decision model. This model
focuses on the experience of the decision maker, tactics such as
intuition and mental simulation, and a decision-making strategy that
emphasizes coming to conclusions without direct comparisons.</p>
<p>Klein emphasizes the importance of the decision maker’s level of
expertise. Experts in a field are able to “see the invisible” <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0CPZZ5">(Klein,
2017, p. 151)</a>. Their
experiences allow them to better pattern match, consciously or
unconsciously, often resulting in gut feeling about the right decision.
Nurses in a NICU were often able to tell when a baby was at risk of
becoming septic and when to put them on antibiotics. When asked to
explain her decision, one nurse listed out a series of symptoms and cues
she looked out for, some typical textbook symptoms and others based
specifically on her experience. Klein points out that the best decision
makers also know that their intuition can be fallible, but years of
experience allow them to notice positive and negative cues, categorize
which events as typical or atypical, have broad situational awareness,
and discern minute differences in given information or situations.</p>
<p>The Recognition-Primed Decision model relies heavily on mental
simulations. Decision makers create mental models, usually containing no
more than three key factors, to imagine what might occur in a given
situation. Klein interviewed a lieutenant firefighter about his decision
making process during the rescue of a woman who jumped off a highway
overpass and was lying semi-conscious on a metal fence below. First, the
lieutenant considered using a rescue harness. He imagined snapping it
onto the woman and realized she might fall off the fence as they
attempted to attach it. He discarded the idea, and then imagined
attaching the rescue harness from the back. Again, the idea was
discarded when he realized she could still fall off. He imagined another
scenario, and then came up with the strategy of using a ladder belt, a
strong belt that firefighters use, to hoist the woman. This processing
all happens in a minute. He moved forward with the last plan, but as
they lifted the woman, he realized that ladder belts are meant for
bulkier firefighters. The woman fell, and was caught by the rescue team
standing with a ladder below her. Mental simulations are not always
accurate, but they allow an expert decision maker to quickly go through
different scenarios, discarding them as needed. When a potential flaw is
revealed through the mental simulation (ex: a fault in attaching the
rescue harness), the decision maker moves onto imagining the next
scenario. This follows the satisficing approach of decision making with
the decision maker selecting the first option that works. Klein argues
that for expert decision makers, the first decision is often the right
one <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?EmCAad">(Klein, 2017)</a>.<span

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>People are under time pressure
all the time in their daily lives both personally and professionally.
The studies discussed indicate that time pressure impacts decision
making, whether or not one is always cognizant of the change. Normative
strategies that are supposed to result in the best decisions perform
poorly under time pressure. In fact, in Payne’s classic experiment of
JDM under time pressure, the normative strategy underperformed every
other possible strategy when participants were choosing between
different gambles <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?aseahd">(Payne et al.,
1996)</a>. Time pressure can
also result in preference reversals as seen in an experiment with
college students choosing housing; the students preferred one type of
housing over the other under time pressure, and the opposite without the
time constraint <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?gumnhH">(Svenson &amp; Edland,
1987)</a>. Strategies that
increase performance under time pressure include EBA and LEX both of
which emphasize selecting one or a select few attributes to focus on and
conducting a breadth-first search <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4lVFih">(Bettman et al.,
1998)</a>. Using these
heuristics, one is able to get through more options in less time, even
if each option is evaluated less rigorously. In contrast, experts,
possibly some of the best decision makers, rely not on simple
heuristics, but on years of experience. Under time pressure, their
knowledge gives them an edge. They are able to create mental
simulations, rely on instinct, and come to conclusions about possible
choices more quickly <a class="reference external" href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?t9bS25">(Klein,
2017)</a>.<span
